# Piracy in the Open Seas
## The Definition
- Old Age - Piracy is defined by sailors plundering merchant ships in the open seas.
- Modern Age - Online piracy is defined by copying and distributing copyrighted software illegally.

In the old ages, piracy is defined by sailors plundering merchant ships in the open seas. The goods would then be sold into the black market. Today in the digital world, piracy is defined by the act of copying files and distributing them illegally. Ultimately, piracy in the act of stealing and piracy in the act of copying are fundamentally different.
## The Problem
- Vulnerabilities - Many users were vulnerable to all kinds of malware and phishing.
- 
## The Reason
- Third World Countries - Countries with low gross domestic product (GDP) tend to suffer most with piracy especially those in poverty.
- Service Issues - Some paid services provide services that are terrible than their pirated counterparts.
## The Solution
- Better Pricing - Products/services should be priced accordingly to the countries' inflation rate.
- Better Service - Services should do better than their pirated counterparts.
## The Applications
- Piracy should never be justified in the first place, but it should be reduced.
- People should support their favorite creators anywhere they can afford.
## Some Examples
- Steam - Provides a great service and has accumulated a large amount of loyal gamers.
- Apple - As much as I hate to say it, Apple has been really amazing with their security but it is not suited for developers and people with holes in their pockets.
