# Piracy in the Open Internet Seas
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Frem and my penname is Eldeston. This is my view of piracy in the open internet seas.
## Definition
- Old Age - Piracy is defined by sailors plundering merchant ships in the open seas.
- Modern Age - Online piracy is defined by copying and distributing copyrighted software illegally.

In the old ages, piracy is defined by sailors plundering merchant ships in the open seas. The goods would then be sold into the black market. Today in the digital world, piracy is defined by the act of copying files and distributing them illegally. Ultimately, piracy in the act of stealing and piracy in the act of copying are fundamentally different.
## Problem
- Lost Revenue - Billions of dollars are lost to online piracy.
- Vulnerabilities - Many users are vulnerable to all kinds of malware, phishing, and suspicious content.

Revenue is lost to small content creators that depend on selling their software from piracy. Controversially though, not all software are worthy and may demand ethical wisdom. Many users are also vulnerable to all kinds of malware and phishing scams through suspicious advertisements. This is especially important to innocent children browsing the web.
## Reason
- Service Issues - Some paid services provide services that are terrible than their pirated counterparts.
- Financial Issues - Countries with low gross domestic product (GDP) tend to suffer most with piracy especially those in poverty.

Most of the reasons why people pirate were either 2 things - service issues and financial issues. Service issues are problems that comes from the service itself. For example Netflix does not allow you to watch videos in 4K on a computer compared to on an Android TV.  Digital Rights Management (DRM) software that requires users to be online or causing performance issues. Adobe requiring users to allow them to use their works for artificial intelligence. Another reason is financial issues. This is especially true for people in poverty or in third world countries with low Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The list goes on.
## Solution
- Better Service - Services should do better than their pirated counterparts.
- Better Pricing - Products/services should be priced accordingly to the countries' inflation rate.

So how do we counter piracy? Taking down pirates will only make more. The solution is to solve at the root of the problem. Services should do better than their pirated counterparts. It should be easy enough for the end user to use their product. Services should sell what is advertised - if you buy a 4K package you will get the same 4K package in any device. Softwares should run without performance issues or have an internet requirement, even if you have to risk losing the DRM software itself. Services should stay consistent with the userbase. Prices can be regionally adjusted according to the country's inflation rate.
## Applications
- Piracy should never be justified in the first place, but it should be reduced.
- People should support their favorite creators anywhere they can afford.

Piracy should never be justified in the first place, but it should be reduced. While some people think piracy is justified against ill intent companies, or companies thinking it should be strictly illegal, profit should not be prioritized over the consumer. At the same time for consumers, they should support their favorite creators wherever they can afford be it sharing via word of mouth, buying, or feedback.
## Some Examples
- Steam - Provides a great service and has accumulated a large amount of loyal gamers.
- Apple - As much as I hate to say it, Apple has been really amazing with their security but it is not suited for developers and people with holes in their pockets.
