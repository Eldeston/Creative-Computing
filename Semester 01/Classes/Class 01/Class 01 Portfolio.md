> "Interaction Design Foundation As designers it is our job to support users not only by providing them with the information necessary for their tasks, aims and objectives, but to arrange this information in a way that promotes automatic perception. In addition, you must present information in a way that enables the user to focus on what they are trying to achieve, without having to devote significant amounts of time translating their intentions according to the constraints of the product, device or system they are interacting with."
