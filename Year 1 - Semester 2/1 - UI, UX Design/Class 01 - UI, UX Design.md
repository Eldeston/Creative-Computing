# UI, UX Design 1
# Ideation & UX Design
The aim of this module is to expose the full design cycle, from initial idea generation and analysis, audience research and user profiling, through interface design (across device types) and prototype development, to testing, evaluation, and iteration.
## Ideation
It is about engaging the human mind to generate creative ideas and cognitive analysis to make concepts or prototypes and make thorough testing.
## UX (User Experience) Design
It is about user experience design which involves how the user is served in their perspective through service.
# Learning Outcomes

- Plan and execute creative solutions to a variety of briefs and prompts.
- Conduct audience research/data analysis that leads to a clear specification of user needs.
- Demonstrate effective translation of design specification  to prototypes that draw on the key principles of interface/user experience design.

# Debate : Born creative or trained creative?
Creativity is a unique trait to humankind that is truly supernatural and cannot be fully explained, but my belief tells me that everyone has the same creative trait in some form or another - It's just that not everyone is good at it. In Ratatouille Gusto says his popular quote: "**Anyone can cook**, but only the fearless can be great." So my argument is that everyone is capable for creativity and everyone can train themselves to unlock their full potential of their creativity through applied imagination. I also believe that creativity is not subject to our environment but given from something or someone that has infinite creativity.
