# Reading Week
Ideation and UI/UX Design assigned us books to read to take note when building an app.
## Be case-insensitive #43
When it comes to making forms and filling in emails or usernames, forms should default to case-insensitive. The reason for this is because domains and emails are case-insensitive. The form should also clarify if the form they are filling is case-sensitive when needed. The form should only be case-sensitive if there is a good reason to. For example, usernames to increase the available usernames when users try to sign up.
## If a good experience can be delivered, your users will love the product #44
All kinds of software almost always include a form, but forms are tedious for users. They dislike it and more so if they have an impatient character. Users need good first impressions if we want them to keep our reputation and stay in our app. So in order to make a good form, the process needs to be optimized and streamlined. Don't ask for more information than needed when making a form. At best, a user will be able to join your app if it is limited to only asking information on email or number, password, name, and address (optional). Any more than that and it will be unbearable for the user.
## Validate data entry as soon as possible #45
When input data is incorrect or missing, it should be validated and give user feedback as soon as possible and wherever possible. This massively reduces time on writing your username, email, and passwords and the user doesn't have to click one more button to sign in or sign up. Do not wait for the user to finish the form for validation and do not clear the form when it is invalid.
