# Ideation & UX Design 10
## Modrinth
- Usability - The design is simplistic & clean.
- Clarity - The design purpose is clear and maximized.
- Aesthetics - The app has good dark themes with a nice green accent.
- Accessibility - The app lets you manage instances easily.
- Empathy - The development team is active on feedback.

Modrinth has a good website design
## CurseForge
- Usability

CurseForge should redesign their launcher for authors/developers because their tools are inconvenient to use. The website still uses its legacy website when it comes to managing creator messages.
