# Ideation & UX Design 2

> There is no doubt that creativity is the most important resource of all. Without creativity, there would be no progress, and we would be forever repeating the same patterns.
> *- Edward De Bono*

# What is Ideation & Problem Solving
## Ideation
- Ideation is the process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas.
- It involves tapping into one's creativity to envision novel solutions, products, or strategies
## Innovation In Software Development
Ideation is the catalyst for groundbreaking software development. Creative problem-solving allows developers to overcome challenges, leading to the creation of more efficient algorithms, user-friendly interfaces, and innovative applications.

For example; User of arrays (unoptimized) vs hashmaps (optimized) in algorithms.

> Big O! notation - It is an optimization formula that calculates the amount of time/instructions it takes to solve a problem.

## User-Centered Design
Understanding user needs is crucial in computing. Ideation ensures that user-centered design principles are

## Cybersecurity Solutions
The constant threat of cyber attacks requires creative problem-solving to develop robust cybersecurity solutions. Ideation is instrumental in anticipating potential threats and developing innovative defense mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information
## Artificial Intelligence
Ideation fuels the progress of AI by conceptualizing new algorithms, frameworks, add applications. Creative problem-solving is instrumental in addressing the ethical and societal challenges posed by AI, ensuring responsible development and deployment.

For example; Model Training Process (Input > Hidden Layer > Output)
## Agile Development Practices
Agile methodologies, widely adopted in the computing industry, industry, emphasize iterative development, and collaboration. Ideation and creative problem-solving are integral to the agile process, enabling teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver innovative solutions quickly.
## Digital Optimization
Optimizing digital resources requires creative problem-solving to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Ideation plays a crucial role in developing new approaches to resource allocation, scalability, and data management.
## Cross-Disciplinary Collaborations
Computing is increasingly intertwined with other disciplines such as healthcare, finance, and education. Ideation facilities cross-disciplinary collaborations, fostering the development of innovative

# Principle of Creative Thinking
## Principle of Decomposition
## Principle of Association
### Walt Disney Method
- The Dreamer - Focuses on big ideas and vision with no limitations.
- The Realist - Focuses on how to make ideas happen in the real world.
- The Critic - Focuses on potential obstacles or problems with the ideas.
### 6 Thinking Hats
- White Hat - Focuses on facts, data, and information
- Red Hat - Focuses on emotion and feelings
- Black Hat - Focuses on caution, risks, and critical judgement
- Yellow Hat - Focuses on positive aspects and benefits
- Green Hat - 
- Blue Hat -

## Principle of Analogy and Confrontation
Analogy and confrontation help us see things differently. By comparing ideas from different fields and challenging what we already know, we can come up with new solutions.

For example; AI & Brain Functions
## Principle of Abstraction and Imagination
The problem is solved on a higher or illusionary level.
## Challenge Common Wisdom and Industry Conventions
Nothing is to be accepted

### Do mental exercises
Demand a new number of new ideas from yourself. Under pressure and try to develop new ideas from one or more problems per day.
### Change your habits
Do something completely different: Changing habits and conventions is a success factor specially for radical innovation.
### Do experiment
The trial under the approach

### Do networking
Search or promote exchange with other example people from other disciplines, cultures, business areas, and departments are extra partners.
### Overcome the barriers to creativity
Creativity disturbing environment
Stress
Lack of recognition/reward for creative work
Two rigid or strict institutional controls
Fear of change, risk aversion
Perfectionism, search for the right things
