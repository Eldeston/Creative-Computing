            <h1>📗 Biography_</h1>
            <p>I am a self-taught Filipino developer in United Arab Emirates. I am a rookie who creates content for fun and for family support. I am a student of Metaverse Age Training Institute in Bath Spa. I am the founder and leader of FlameRender™ Studios and have developed projects under my studio. I prioritize maximum optimization, diligent documentation, and code formatting for all my projects. Most of my projects revolve around Minecraft, but I aim to participate and/or branch out to other kinds of projects related to software and computers.</p>

            <h1>💻 Professions_</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am a shader developer working for myself while studying in Metaverse Age Training Institute for Creative Computing Level 4 and I am not for hire (yet). By the end of this course, I may pursue Game Development, Cyber Security, Data Analyst, or Artificial Intelligence, but for now I will see which of these interest me most as I continue to learn.</p>
            <p>As I work for myself as a shader developer, the work I do mostly revolves around programming shaders. I also make videos to showcase my own work. I have previously used Kinemaster, Hitfilm, and CapCut. Now, I have moved to Davinci Resolve after gaining better hardware.</p>
