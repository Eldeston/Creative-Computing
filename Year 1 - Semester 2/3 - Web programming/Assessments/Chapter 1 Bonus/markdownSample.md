## Header Tag `<h1>`
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tag.

`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

> **NOTE:** Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

## Paragraph Tag `<p>`
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

### Horizontal Rule Tag `<hr>`
The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

```
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
```

The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

### Line Break Tag `<br>`
The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break.

Use `<br>` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

```
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```

The `<br>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

### Preformatted Text Tag `<pre>`
The HTML `<pre>` element defines preformatted text.

```
<pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    My Bonnie lies over the sea.

    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
```

The text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

### Bold Tag `<b>`
The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

```
<b>This text is bold</b>
```

### Itallic Tag `<i>`
The HTML `<i>` element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

```
<i>This text is italic</i>
```

### Delete Tag `<p>`
The HTML `<del>` element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.

```
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
```

### Insert Tag `<ins>`
The HTML `<ins>` element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

```
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
```

## Comment Tag `<p>`
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code or hide content temporarily.

```
<!-- This code never gives you up. -->
<p>Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you.</p>
```

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.
