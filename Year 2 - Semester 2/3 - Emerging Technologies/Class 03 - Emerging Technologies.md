# Emerging Technologies 1
1. The political impact of social media is more positive than it is negative.
2. Human beings are becoming too reliant on digital and social media, to the detriment of our physical and psychological health.
3. Artificial intelligence threatens to take over too many aspects of our lives that should be left to humans.
4. The growth of eLearning and other forms of non-traditional education will eventually make the traditional university irrelevant.
5. The continued growth in the use of digital and emerging technologies will ultimately have a negative impact on the environment.
6. The continued growth of new technologies will make our world a safer place.
