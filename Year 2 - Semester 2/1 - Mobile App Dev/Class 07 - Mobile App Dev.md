# Mobile App Dev 3

# Updated Technical Documentation
## Introduction
This document provides a technical analysis of the _FDR Sports Academy_ website. It was prepared by the developers of Orion as part of the documentation requirements for our Creative Computing group project. The goal is to present an up‑to‑date overview of the website’s structure, platform, and technical performance based on direct inspection using browser developer tools.

Although not within the primary scope of this analysis, it is worth briefly noting the related website _FDR Events_, which is owned by the same company. FDR Events is more mature in its development, reflecting the company’s longer operational history.
# FDR Sports Academy
The FDR Sports Academy website functions primarily as a static portfolio site. It does not collect user data and does not include backend functionality beyond what is provided by its website‑building platform. The site is built using WordPress.com’s block‑based system, resulting in a static front‑end experience with no custom server‑side logic.

# FDR Events (Related Website)
The FDR Events website appears to be built using Squarespace. This aligns with the company’s timeline, as FDR Sports Academy was established only a year ago, and WordPress may have been chosen for budgetary reasons. FDR Events is more feature‑complete and visually refined, consistent with its longer development cycle.

# Specifications
## Platform

- The FDR Sports Academy website is built using **WordPress.com**, utilizing a block‑based theme.
- The domain is hosted through **Zoho**.
- The site is static in nature and relies entirely on WordPress’s built‑in features rather than custom backend development.
- The DOM structure is heavily nested due to WordPress block generation, contributing to layout complexity.
## Assumptions

- FDR Events is likely built with **Squarespace**, based on its design patterns and the company’s history.
- WordPress was likely chosen for FDR Sports Academy due to cost efficiency, ease of setup, and the need for a simple portfolio‑style site.
# Issues Identified (Based on DevTools Inspection)
## 1. Broken Navigation Bar (About Us Page)
The navigation bar on the About Us page is non‑functional due to a **z‑index conflict**.  
A block wrapper on that page sits above the header, preventing menu items from being clicked. This issue does not appear on other pages, indicating a page‑specific layout or CSS inconsistency.
## 2. Clipping and Overlapping Elements
Several elements exhibit clipping issues, where invisible containers overlap buttons or links.  
This is caused by:

- Absolute‑positioned blocks
- Incorrect z‑index values
- Containers with `overflow: hidden`
- Inconsistent responsive rules

These issues affect both desktop and mobile layouts.
## 3. Slow Page Loading
The site loads noticeably slowly, especially on first visit.  
DevTools analysis shows the following causes:

- **Large, uncompressed images** (some exceeding 1–2 MB)
- **Render‑blocking CSS** loaded in the `<head>`
- **Multiple external requests**, including Google Fonts and WordPress analytics
- **Heavy DOM structure** generated by the block theme

Although WordPress applies some optimization automatically, the theme and media assets significantly impact performance.
## 4. Codebase Not Optimized
The underlying codebase appears unoptimized due to:

- Excessive inline CSS generated by WordPress blocks
- Unused CSS and JavaScript loaded by the theme
- Deeply nested DOM elements
- No manual optimization of assets or layout

These issues collectively reduce rendering efficiency and contribute to layout instability.
