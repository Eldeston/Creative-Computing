# Clone Task 1: Layout and Typography

Your task is to create the website for a blog post about the Erased Tapes Records music label. 

You must implement the website according to the [written specification](#target-devices) and [wireframe mock-ups](wireframes) provided. For any details that have not been specified, you must make appropriate design decisions about how to implement that detail. All required changes to the design on different screen sizes are shown in the wireframes or are explained below. The images and placeholder text you will need are provided in the [`assets`](assets) folder.

## Target Devices

The design is based around the following target devices.

| Target device | Viewport width      | Breakpoint |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Small Mobile  | **`360px-540px`**   |            |
| Large Mobile  | **`540px-720px`**   | `540px`    |
| Tablet        | **`720px-1024px`**  | `720px`    |
| Desktop       | **`1024px`** and up | `1024px`   |

## Specification

1. The content background colour should be white. The page background colour should be `#e9e9e9`. The footer background colour should be `#14181d`.

2. Elements should use the following standard spacing values for margins, padding, and gaps.
   | Target device                  | Standard spacing |
   | -------------                  | -------------    |
   | Small Mobile (less than 540px) | `12px`           |
   | Large Mobile (540px and above) | `20px`           |
   | Tablet                         | `30px`           |
   | Desktop                        | `50px`           |

3. The author's photo should be `200px` wide.

4. On desktop, the logo should be `200px` wide. On mobile and tablet, it should be `80px`

5. Typography should adhere to the following specification:
    
    1. Headings should use the `"Protest Guerrilla"` font family. All other text should use `"Josefin Sans"`. These should be imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
    2. Headings should be three times larger than the default font size. On desktop, the title heading should be much larger, as shown in the wireframe.
    3. On desktop, the first paragraph should be a larger font.
    4. On all screen sizes, typography and spacing should be optimised to make the text as legible as possible. Therefore, paragraphs and headings do not have to use the standard spacing.
