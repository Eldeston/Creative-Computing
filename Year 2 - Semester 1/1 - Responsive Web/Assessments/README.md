*Project created by Frem Patalinghug, prepared for Assessment 1 of Responsive Web. The completed tasks are in folders ['Task 1'](Task-1) and ['Task 2'](Task-2).*

# S1: Clone Tasks

There is one folder for each Clone Task. Each folder contains the files you will need for that exercise. You should start by reading the `README` specification first. This will be easier to do if you open your GitHub repository in Visual Studio Code, or view your repository on GitHub.com.

Your solution to each exercise should be well organised, appropriately named, and easy to find.

**Only code pushed to your GitHub repository before the assessment deadline will be marked. Ensure you give yourself enough time before your final push.**

## The Brief

This assessment tests your ability to write high-quality and responsive HTML/CSS. For each task, you must create a webpage based on the specification provided. The specification includes wireframes showing what the page should look like on different screen sizes, as well as a written statement with additional details. You must implement the specification as accurately as possible. However, the specifications are not comprehensive, and you will also be marked the quality of the design choices you make when specifics have not been given.

There are two tasks:

* **Task 1:** Responsive Layout and Typography 
* **Task 2:** Advanced Layout

*You must attempt both tasks to pass the assessment.*

The tasks will predominately test your ability to implement responsive designs with CSS Media Queries and to implement complex layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox. You can test your solutions on different screen sizes using the browser developer tools in your web browser.

In summary, you must ensure that your solutions:

* Match the specification as accurately as possible.
* Make good design decisions when the specification is incomplete.
* Respond well across all screen sizes.
* Make effective use CSS Media Queries, Flexbox, and Grid.
* Use CSS selectors, classes, and styling techniques efficiently.
* Use semantic HTML elements thoroughly.
* Are well commented and formatted.

*The specifications, as well as any media assets required to create the page, are included in the GitHub repository.*
