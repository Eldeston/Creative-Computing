# Clone Task 2: Advanced Layout

Your task is to create the website for 'watch.it', a made-up movie streaming service. 

You must implement the website according to the [written specification](#target-devices) and [wireframe mock-ups](wireframes) provided. For any details that have not been specified, you must make appropriate design decisions about how to implement that detail. All required changes to the design on different screen sizes are shown in the wireframes or are explained below. The images and text you will need are provided in the [`assets`](assets) folder.

## Target Devices

The design is based around the following target devices.

| Target device | Viewport width      | Breakpoint |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Mobile        | **`360px-720px`**   |            |
| Tablet        | **`720px-1024px`**  | `720px`    |
| Desktop       | **`1024px`** and up | `1024px`   |

## Specification

1. The colours used should be taken from the watch.it brand colours. It is not a requirement to use every colour.
