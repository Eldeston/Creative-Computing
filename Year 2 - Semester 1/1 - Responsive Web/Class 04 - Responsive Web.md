# Responsive Web 2
## The Key Principles
- Adaptive layouts vs responsive layouts
	- Adaptive layouts - Designed specifically for individual devices
	- Responsive layouts - Designed to be flexible for different devices
- Mobile first approach vs desktop first approach
	- Mobile first approach makes responsive web design more easier
	- Desktop first approach can quickly be difficult as the screen size gets smaller
- Content-centered design
- Navigation & usability
- Use relative unites (Percentages, EMs, REMs)
- Other considerations
	- Vector images vs bitmaps
	- System fonts vs webfonts
	- Keeping your design lightweight
	- Managing white (empty) space on mobile devices
	- Avoiding fixed elements on mobile devices
	- Reasonable adjustment for landscape orientations
## Activity 1
- Research 3 hotel booking websites, do this using a mobile device or web developer tools
- Not the type of information that you see on the home page
- Review what information exists above and below the fold (the top of the page and the bottom of the page)
- Generate a hierarchy of information (an ordered list of importance) for a new hotel booking website
