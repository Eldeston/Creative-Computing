# Digital Storytelling 6
# Videography Tips
## Research
- First and foremost, do your research.
- Review as many as possible; and collect several examples of the “kind” of the videos (as reference & inspiration) you like, relate to and would try to create (recreate).
- Take notes on the frame, location, subject, props, lighting, technique, transitions, etc.
## Equipment
- DSLR is not required, & use your phone that you are most comfortable with.
- A tripod is highly recommended, & a stabilizing gimbal would be perfect.
- Always use the main back camera for better quality footage.
- Always shoot in landscape mode.
- Turn on the overlay grid on your screen for very helpful guidance.
- Always shoot at:
	- 1080 pixel resolution (no 720 or 4K pls)
	- 60 frames per second
## Plan Your Shoot
- Try to plan, visualize & document your full video production from start to finish.
- Create your own storyboard with casual illustrations of your scenes in sequence.
- Try to pre-visualize your final footage and outline your desired shots.
- This should guide you with the kind, duration and type (time lapse, slow motion) of footage you need to shoot.
## Have Good Lighting
- Photography is “drawing with light”, and bad lighting will create bad drawings.
- Pay attention and plan your shoot with the light in mind, and adequately on & around the subject.
- Try to maintain consistency in the lighting across the footage.
## Pay Attention to the Background
- Don’t just film anywhere, & make an effort to use a simple background or improve it by removing as much clutter as you can. 
- The key is to minimize elements that will make the scene look cluttered and take attention away from your subject.
## Frame
- Good videography involves more than just aiming your camera at your scene or subject, & takes changing your camera’s framing in order to make the scene look aesthetically pleasing.
- See what you are going to shoot, and how it looks on screen, before you shoot.
- Experiment with angles, as the angles you use to capture your content have a huge influence on mood and perspective.
## Use Manual Focus
- While the autofocus feature on your camera can be very handy, it can ruin your recording when it continuously goes in and out of focus while trying to locate your subject in the frame.
- Use the exposure/focus lock on your smartphone or switch to manual focus on your standalone camera, so you can use your own eyes and set the focus yourself.
- Setting the focus also allows you to add cool effects to your video, such as with the use of the rack focus technique where you can focus on different objects successively (with the help of a shallow depth of field blurring everything else out) to direct your viewer’s attention. When used properly, it can be a very powerful tool for storytelling.
