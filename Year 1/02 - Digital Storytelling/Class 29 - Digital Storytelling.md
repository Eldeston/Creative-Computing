# Digital Storytelling 10
# Assessment 3 - Non-Linear Story
Your task is to create an interactive, non-linear story based on a given narrative. Your project must contain text, images and hyperlinking and be compiled using the online storytelling platform, Twinery.
# Assessment 3 - 30% Non Linear Story
The interactive story must take, as its starting point, any one of the following fairy tales:
- The Three Little Pigs
- Jack and the Beanstalk
- Little Red Riding Hood
- Goldilocks and the Three Bears
- Rumpelstiltskin
- The Pied Piper of Hamelin
- The Frog Prince
- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
- Rapunzel
- Cinderella
- Beauty and the Beast

The version of the fairy tale you present is up to you.

You may adapt and extend the story to introduce opportunities for interactivity. These adaptations may take the form of side quests, story divergence and convergence and so on.

An important requirement however is that your story follows the general direction of your chosen fairy tale: that is, it presents the same key message (i.e. the moral of the story), and follows a comparable narrative arch to the original text. Creative license is however permitted to offer alternative endings, to set the tale in a different story world, and introduce narrative elements that support non-linearity.

## Included Media
Your interactive story must include, as a minimum requirement, text and hyperlinks. You may however wish to gain extra credit by incorporating embedded image, video, sound and other media into the work, as well as adjust the styling of the story using CSS.

The media you chose to include should add value to the story however, and not be added simply to try and achieve higher marks. Poor use of embedded content is more likely to reduce marks for ‘creativity’ and ‘presentation’ more than it increases marks for ‘technique and development’ (see marking criteria for more information).
## Other Techniques
To enhance the interactive nature of your story, you may wish to use variables, conditional statements and other coding features recognized by Twine.
## Deliverable
The word file cover sheet complete with all the requirements:
- Your name
- Title’s screenshot
- Story map screenshot
- itch.io link to online live interactive story
- Google Drive link with (HTML export, images & audios)
- YouTube link to the screen recording
- Critical reflection (150 words)

# Script
Once upon a time, a young boy named Jack lived with his family in a poor residence. One day, Jack's father decided that Jack should make a profit by selling their vegetables in the main city. So Jack took the vegetables and went his way to the main city riding the family mule. Jack arrived at the city and began putting his vegetables on sale. Unfortunately, Jack did not make profit from his sales, and was disappointed.

Then, a mysterious man came to him and asked if he could acquire his mule. Jack refused to offer his mule with no price. The mysterious man offered 3 small beans and said it has certain magical properties. Jack easily bought his claim and thought he could make a fortune with these beans and accepted. He then traded the family mule for a measly 3 "magic" beans.

When Jack came home he reported to father what he had done, and his father was severely disappointed. Father then threw the beans into a nearby river bank.

Suddenly, as the beans fell into the bank's waters, grew a tall, tall beanstalk. Jack was amazed by the heights it reached as it continued to reach the heavens. He decided to scale the beanstalk to repay his family.

As he arrived at the top of the beanstalk, he arrived on a floating island flourishing with giant flora. He saw giant grape vines, giant apple trees, and giant peaches.

He took all that he can but suddenly he saw a hungry giant, seeking prey that he may eat. Jack hid beneath the ferns.

As the hungry giant passed by, he caught a glimpse of a large bag of large gold coins. Jack sought to steal it.

When the giant slept, Jack took the large bag of coins from the hungry giant, but as Jack escaped with the gold the hungry giant was alerted and chased Jack.

Jack escaped with the fruits and gold as he scaled down the beanstalk as the hungry giant followed. Quickly, he alerted his family to grab an axe to cut the beanstalk down. The beanstalk fell, and the giant fell along with it and died.

Jack's family was pleased not because of his findings, but that Jack was safe and sound. So they grew and sold what Jack had found and lived happily ever after.
