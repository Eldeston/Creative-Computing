# Color Terminologies
## Hues
**Tint** - Hue mixed with the color white. This will lighten the color, but does not brighten the color.
**Shade** - Hue mixed with the color black. A shade will darken the version of the original hue.
**Tone** - Hue mixed with the color grey.

A **color scheme** is a planned combination of colors that are used together in a design, artwork, or any visual project to create a specific aesthetic.

**Monochromatic** refers to a color scheme that uses different shades, tints, and tones of a single hue. This means that instead of mixing multiple colors, a monochromatic scheme is created by altering the lightness (shades) or darkness (tints) of one base color.

**Analogous** colors are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Even if you add shades (darkening) or tints (lightening), the analogous relationship remains intact.

**Complementary** colors are pairs of colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. These colors create a strong, eye-catching effect.

**Triadic colors** refer to a color scheme consisting of three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. While triadic colors provide contrast, their equal distance from each other creates a sense of harmony.
