# Digital Visual Design 2
## Graphic Design
Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. Graphic design uses visual compositions to solve problems and communicate ideas through typography, imagery, color and form.
## Graphic Design vs Visual Design
### Graphic Design
Meanings & Communication
- Inform users
- Attract users
- Entice users
- Inspire users
### Visual Design
Usability & Aesthetic Appeal
- Support users use a product or service most efficiently
- Make the stay pleasant and comfortable
## 8 types of Graphic Design
- Visual identity
- Marketing & advertising
- User interface
- Publication
- Packaging
- Motion
- Environmental
- Art and illustration
## Visual Identity
Focus on the visual elements of a brand, such as logos, typography, and color schemes, to create a recognizable and cohesive identity.
### Visual Identity: 4 Key elements of cohesive identity
1. **Consistency:** Consistent visual elements across all platforms to reinforce brand’s identity and make it recognizable.
	**Example:** The iconic golden arches and the red and yellow color scheme are consistent across all McDonald's restaurants, packaging, and advertising.

1. **Harmony:** Different visual elements work together in harmony to create a cohesive and visually appealing whole.
	**Example:** Apple's minimalist design aesthetic, clean lines, and use of white space create a harmonious and cohesive visual identity across all its products and marketing materials.

3. **Relevance:** The identity should be relevant to the brand's target audience and messaging. It should convey the brand's values and personality in a way that resonates with consumers.
	**Example:** Tiffany & Co. ; A luxury jewelry brand's use of the color blue, its iconic Tiffany setting, and its elegant typography convey a sense of sophistication and timeless beauty.

4. **Memorability:** A strong cohesive identity should be memorable and easily recognizable.
	**Example:** The swoosh logo and the "Just Do It" slogan are instantly recognizable and have become synonymous with the brand.
## Marketing & Advertising
It involves creating visuals that promote products or services and influence consumer behavior.

These designs are used in various platforms such as print, digital, and social media.
### CocaCola
- Coca-Cola's print ads evoke positive emotions and create a sense of nostalgia.
- The company's strategic use of color, themes, and imagery has been instrumental in building a strong emotional connection with consumers worldwide.
## Publication
Publications are long-form pieces that communicate with an audience through public distribution. They have traditionally been a print medium. Publication design is a classic type of design—think books, newspapers, magazines and catalogs.
## Packaging
Packaging design can communicate directly to consumers, which makes it an extremely valuable marketing tool. Every box, bottle and bag, every can, container, or canister is a chance tell the story of a brand.
## Motion
Motion graphics are graphics that are in motion. This can include animation, audio, typography, imagery, video and other effects that are used in online media, television and film.
## Environmental
Environmental graphic design visually connects people to places to improve their overall experience by making spaces more memorable, interesting, informative or easier to navigate.

**Example:** Wayfinding signs in airports guide people using simple, clear visuals.
## Art and illustration
Artists and illustrators create original artwork that take a number of forms, from fine art to decoration to storytelling illustrations.
## User Interface
A user interface (UI) is how a user interacts with a device or application. UI design is the process of designing interfaces to make them easy to use and provide a user-friendly experience.
## ‘Thoughts on Graphic Position’
A piece of theoretical design research by Brazilian graphic designer Nei Valente.

Nei created a survey to discover how people subconsciously ascribe meaning to positioning of elements, even with no distinguishing visual information beyond where a square is located on the page – and the results will be of interest whether your an artist or UX designer.

**‘Thoughts on Graphic Position’** study is an important evidence for us to acknowledge the power of the most subtle graphic clues, capable of generating subtle or explicit meanings across users.
## What are Visual Aesthetics?
An artistically beautiful or pleasing appearance.

The term “visual” indicates concentration on the visual sense, which is the central human sense, occupying almost half the brain.

3 perspectives:
- The Design perspective
- The Psychological perspective
- The Practical perspective
## Design Perspective
This perspective focuses on the use of elements like color, form, composition, and layout to create visually engaging and harmonious designs.
## Psychological Perspective
Designers use this perspective to create visuals that evoke specific emotional responses and improve user experience. Since vision occupies nearly half the brain's resources, visuals impact emotions, attention, and perception.

**Example:** Instagram redesigned its logo in 2016 to a more simplified, gradient icon, evoking modernity and creativity, appealing to a younger, digitally-savvy audience.
## Practical Perspective
This perspective focuses on the functionality and usability of a design. Design elements are used not just for aesthetics but to serve a clear purpose, ensuring the design is user-friendly and practical in real-world applications.

**Example:** Airbnb’s website design balances beauty and usability, with an intuitive layout that guides users seamlessly through the booking process.
## Theories
**Positive Effect Mediation Theory** *by Norman*
Visually pleasant systems induce positive emotions in users, leading to a supportive cognitive state, finally resulting in better performance with them.

**Processing Fluency Theory** *by Szabo*
Well-designed aesthetic interfaces inherently require less cognitive effort on the user's part, and hence are easy and fluent to operate and complete the task.

**Increased Motivation Theory** *by Sonderegger*
Aesthetically attractive systems naturally attract and motivate the users, and consequently improve their performance.

## Perspective, Position, and Context Matters
- Perspective matters
	- Aerial Perspective
	- Landscape Perspective
- Position matters
	- Golden Ratio
	- 3x3 Grid

All points together create a context in our minds that defines a story that resonates to the user's brain through imagination.
## Website Analysis
Factorio has a consistent and elegant theme of steampunk, technology, and chaos yet in control. I wouldn't change anything about it as it resonates with my past experience as a developer, a problem solver, and a player. The website makes me wants me to expand, solve, develop, and conquer. The factory MUST GROW!
