> We are lonesome animals. We spend all our life trying to be less lonesome. One of our ancient methods is to tell a story begging the listener to say — and to feel — “Yes, that’s the way it is, or at least that’s the way I feel it. You’re not as alone as you thought.”
> *- John Steinbeck

> "There have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories.”
> *- Ursula K. LeGuin*

> “Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today.”
> *- Robert McKee*

## Humans are hardwired for stories

Human brain has the natural ability to “fill in the gaps.” This is called "imagination." God has given each one of us a unique capability to imagine.

> [!NOTE]
> There's a quote from Pilgrim's Progress movie on imagination. Imagination is one of God's characters as the Creator of the universe and we are created in His image, proving God's influence and existence on us.

## Stories around us
> “For a given audience, a story is a sequence of content, anchored on a problem, which engages that audience with emotion and meaning.”
> *- Bryan Alexander*

A story is the telling of an event, either true or fictional, in such a way that the **listener experiences or learns something** just by the fact that he heard the story. A story is a means of transferring information, experience, attitude or point of view.

Our brain connects dots (facts/incidents) and “creates” more than what actually is...it creates “stories!”
## What is a Story?
“Story” can be defined as, a series of events.

“Storytelling” can be defined as, relating a series of events.

“Story” and “narrative” mean the same thing. “Narrative” is simply a more academic term than “story.” In a story, causality is involved in some way (along the lines: A leads to B, B leads to C, C leads to D, etc).
## Myths
A myth is a traditional story without an author that is usually intended to teach a lesson, explain one of the many mysteries of life, explain a phenomenon of nature & describe the customs, institutions, or religious rites of a people

- **Achilles**
	As an infant Achilles' mother dipped him into the River Styx, which made him invulnerable everywhere but the heel by which she held him. For ten years Achilles was a great hero in the Trojan War for the Greeks. But in the end, Paris, son of the Trojan king, fatally wounded Achilles in the heel.
## Fairy Tales
A fairy tale is a children’s story in a magical setting about imaginary characters that include fairies, dwarfs, witches, angels, trolls, and talking animals. It is also known as a folklore genre written in the form of short stories.
## News Stories
The war in Syria had been going on for more than four years when Alan Kurdi’s parents lifted the 3-year-old boy and his 5-year-old brother into an inflatable boat and set off from the Turkish coast for the Greek island of Kos, just three miles away. Within minutes of pushing off, a wave capsized the vessel, and the mother and both sons drowned. On the shore near the coastal town of Bodrum a few hours later, Nilufer Demir of the Dogan News Agency, came upon Alan, his face turned to one side and bottom elevated as if he were just asleep.

Omran Daqneesh was injured on August 17, 2016, in an alleged Russian Air Force strike on the rebel-held al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria. He suffered a wound to his head and was taken to a hospital known as M10 and later discharged.

A young Malian man, Mamoudou Gassama, was hailed a hero on after he sprang into action to save a four-year-old child hanging from a fourth-floor balcony by single-handedly scaling the facade of the building and hauling the youngster to safety.
