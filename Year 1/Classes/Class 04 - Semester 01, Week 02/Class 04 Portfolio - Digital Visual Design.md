## 8 Types of Graphic Design

## Psychological Perspective

## Practical Perspective

## Perspective, Position, and Context Matters
- Perspective matters
	- Aerial Perspective
	- Landscape Perspective
- Position matters

## Website Analysis
Factorio has a consistent and elegant theme of steampunk, technology, and chaos yet in control. I wouldn't change anything about it as it resonates with my past experience as a developer, a problem solver, and a player. The website makes me wants me to expand, solve, develop, and conquer. The factory MUST GROW!
