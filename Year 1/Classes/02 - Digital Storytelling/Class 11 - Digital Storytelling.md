# Editor's Notes
Story explanation used:
- **The Golden Touch** - Strongly inspired from the story of Midas.

There came a king named Midas, who ruled Phrygia and his wants unlimited. He sought and searched for treasure everywhere he went to become the richest. He discovered a demigod who could grant him one wish that he could ask for. He asked that everything his hands touches be made gold. He then came home and touched the pink roses in the garden and it turned into solid gold. He commanded his servants to prepare a feast to celebrate his newfound powers. As the feast began, he could not eat as the food he touches turned into gold. When his daughter approached him and touched his hands she too turned into gold. He mourned for his daughter and cursed his gift. He sought for the demigod to take his gift away from him, but could not find him no longer.
