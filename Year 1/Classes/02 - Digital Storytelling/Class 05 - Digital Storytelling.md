## The 3 Act structure
A story with a 3 act structure consists of a beginning, crisis, and resolution.
## The “ONE DAY” factor
The day before and after the character takes on a turning point.
# Commercial Storytelling
For most of their existence, TV commercials have been like, **“Hey, buy this product! It’s faster, cheaper, more efficient!”**

Then, around 2012, we saw an increase in commercials that tell stories.

They don’t always talk about the **“selling point,”** which was always a big deal in advertising: Why do you have to buy this product? 

Instead of simply telling you about the benefits of the product, they show **how the advertised product can help you achieve your consumption goals.** It doesn’t really say anything directly about the product, but still it’s very persuasive.

Commercial Storytelling is using a narrative to connect your brand & product to your customers.

People remember stories. 

If you put a story capable of evoking emotions in your viewers, they will never forget the experience.

**Brands do not sell their products anymore...they sell stories.**
## Highlight Micro Moments
“Micro-moments” are those small, often overlooked routines and rituals that make up our daily lives: 
tying our shoelaces, sitting down for coffee, commuting to work, brushing our teeth, enjoying a meal, etc.

Facebook calls them “once-a-day moments,” and for advertisers, they can serve as an especially powerful tool for connecting with audiences; in fact, brands that incorporate these moments can sometimes be easier for us to recall and remember.

- One study found that a painting became 11% more valuable when the artist’s story was featured below it. 
- Small businesses with ethically-made, locally-sourced products can actually increase the perceived value of the products by featuring the story of the workers engaged in the production.
# Digital Storytelling
**Storytelling**
Telling or writing of stories. An ancient art form and a valuable form of human expression. Storytelling should always come in narrative form as you are describing your experience in the form of stories.

**Digital**
Computer-based tools, content and delivery.

> “Digital Storytelling is the modern expression of the ancient art of storytelling.”
> *- Barrett, 2007*

> “Digital storytelling combines the art of telling stories with a variety of digital multimedia, such as images, audio, and video. Just about all digital stories bring together some mixture of digital graphics, text, recorded audio narration, video and music to present information on a specific topic.”
> *- Robin, 2008*

> “Digital storytelling involves the use of graphics, images, pictures, sound, and videos to engage the viewers in an effort to drive emotions, engage intercommunication, and motivate an audience to action.”
> *- Eric and Sacha*
