# -------- Exercise 9 --------

# This one is very very easy

# This is a function called "hello"
# Inside we will print to console "Hello" if ever this function is called
def hello():
    print("Hello")  # Fill in this blank to print "Hello" to the console

# Call hello() in main() function
def main():
    hello()  # Fill in this blank to call the hello() function

# __name__ determines the context of the program which in this case is the main line.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call on the function main()
    main()
