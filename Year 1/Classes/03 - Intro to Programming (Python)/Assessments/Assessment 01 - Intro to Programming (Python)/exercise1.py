# -------- Exercise 1 --------

# Initialize first word
word1 = "Coding"
# Initialize second word
word2 = "is"
# Initialize last word
word3 = "cool."

# Editor's Note: The first letter of the third is supposed to be capitalized. Changed it for grammars sake. Otherwise, the following commented line can fix it if needed
# word3 = "Cool."

# Use string concatenation to combine the variables and print the phrase
print(word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3)

# Alternatively, I can use comma instead ","
print(word1, word2, word3)
