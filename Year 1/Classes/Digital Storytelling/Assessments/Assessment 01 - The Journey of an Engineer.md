# Key Characters: Humility and Servitude
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Frem, I go by the penname Eldeston. I am the founder of **FlameRender Studios.** This is the story of how my work as a shader developer came into being from papers and drawings to lights and shadows.
## Papers and Drawings
I spent most of my childhood in the Philippines before coming to Dubai. During my childhood days, I was the bratty kid who wanted everything. I wanted this, I wanted that, and my wants know no end. My parents and my Dad's grandparents had to put up with my antics. Later on though, I was very frustrated on why I couldn't get everything. Then an idea hit me, "Why not make everything yourself?" I discovered I could make anything I wanted, if I had the necessary materials. Like father, like son, I became my own engineer to solve my problems - to make paper toys. My sudden desire to create was more than what I wanted. My imagination overflowed and apparently my brother had the same thought. It later became a problem though as both of us made too much that my grandparents found it as a problem.
## The Inspiration
This inspiration extended to the digital world as I moved to Dubai. I still made toys like origamis and boardgames but at a reduced scale. My addiction to playing Minecraft also grew by that time - one that isn't healthy. However, while fiddling with Minecraft and watching videos about it, I also came across redstone inventions. I thought it was incredible for such a simple block game and tried it myself. I made all sorts of invention but one invention piqued my Dad's interest - redstone computers. Because of his constant monitor on my screentime and recently watching a movie about Snowden (it is about how the US government had been spying on devices without permission but that's another topic), he decided my next gift for my birthday is a book about coding. Without my Dad's keen eye on me, I would not be in this course now.
## The Beginning
Thanks to my parent's inspiration and supportive love, I began my first programming journey. Because of my outstanding confidence that I can make anything, I began programming on the worst workspace possible - the phone. I made basic things like displaying "hello world" with Python and C++. Looking back at it now, I couldn't believe I still pursued programming. This is probably because of my growing love for computers and how people around me find it astonishing how I can easily navigate through a computer first try (yes I'm talking about the boomers). "Programming on a phone can't be that hard," or so I thought. This is the same confidence to create anything that I could imagine that has kept up with me until now.
## "See a need, fill a need."
My Mom was a big fan of movies including my Dad. Lots of inspiration came from binging and rewatching countless movies and series, but movies is what brings us together. One particular movie we all watched, was Robots (2005). The story is about a young engineer robot inspired by Big Weld with the famous quote, "See a need, fill a need." and this quote is repeated a few times as he helped poor robots who could not find the parts to keep their life sustained. Seeing my Dad as the engineer of the house who serves in fixing not only issues in our home, but also in our personal lives. He is the only person in this world who had the biggest influence on me and helped me solved my problems, and there came a day I helped to solve his. He inspired me to not just do something for myself, but to do something for others.
## It is our turn.
This lead into the birth of my many projects: FlameRender Studios, a creator community founded by me, Maud (Maudric, aka my brother), and UserNameGoesHere (Aiden), and Super Duper Vanilla, a shader pack created to convey and recreate the cancelled and forgotten Super Duper Graphics pack.

Now it's your turn. How can you help in this day and age, where there are so many problems that are yet to be solved? Seeing myself now in this course, I want serve and fulfill other's needs - whether it be in the form of solving a physical problem, or a personal problem in someone's life. I know can never fulfil everyone's needs, but I can continue to keep serving my friends and family in humility wherever and whenever I can do. I also hope that I can also teach others this same sense of servitude and humility.
