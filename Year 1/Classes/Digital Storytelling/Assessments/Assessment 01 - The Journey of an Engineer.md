# Key Characters: Humility and Servitude
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Frem, I go by the penname Eldeston. I am the founder of **FlameRender Studios.** This is the story of how my work as a shader developer came into being from papers and drawings to lights and shadows.
## Papers and Drawings
I spent most of my childhood in the Philippines before coming to Dubai and I was the bratty kid who wanted everything. I wanted this and that, and my wants know no end for my Parents and my Dad's Grandparents at least. One day, I was frustrated on why I couldn't get what I want. Then an idea hit me, "Why not make everything yourself?" I discovered I could make anything I wanted, if I had the materials. I became my own engineer to solve my problems - to make paper toys. My sudden desire to make was more than to want. My imagination overflowed and my brother had the same idea and followed. It later became a problem though as both of us made mess for my Grandparents.
## The Inspiration
My imagination extended to the digital world as I moved to Dubai. I still invented toys like origamis and boardgames but my addiction Minecraft grew - one that is not healthy. However, while fiddling with Minecraft and watching videos about it, I also came across redstone. I thought it was incredible for such a simple block game and tried to invent something myself. I made all sorts of inventions but one invention piqued my Dad's interest - redstone computers. Because of his constant monitor on my screentime and recently watching a movie about Snowden (which is about the US government spying on devices without permission but that's another topic), he decided that my next gift for my birthday is a book about coding. Without my Dad's keen eye on me, I would not be in this course now.
## The Beginning
Thanks to my parent's inspiration and supportive love, I began my first programming journey. Because of my outstanding confidence that I can make anything, I began programming on the worst workspace possible - the phone. I made little things like displaying "hello world" with Python and C++. Looking back at it now, I couldn't believe I still pursued programming. This is likely because of my growing love for computers and how people around me find it astonishing how I can navigate in a computer easily (yes I'm talking about the boomers). "Programming on a phone can't be that hard," or so I thought. This is the same confidence that has kept up with me until now.
## "See a need, fill a need."
My Parents were big fans of movies. Lots of inspiration came from binging countless movies and series, but it is what brings my family together. One particular movie, was Robots (2005). The story is about a young robot, Rodney, who look up to Big Weld with the famous quote, "See a need, fill a need." and this quote is repeated throughout the movie as Rodney helped old robots who could not find the parts to keep their life sustained. Seeing my Dad as the engineer of the house who serves in fixing not only issues in our home, but also in my family's lives. He is the only person in this world who had the biggest influence on me and helped me solved my problems, and there came a day I helped to solve his. He inspired me to not just do something for myself, but to do something for others.
## It is our turn.
This lead into the birth of my projects: FlameRender Studios, a creator community founded by me, Maud (Maudric, aka my brother), and UserNameGoesHere (Aiden), and Super Duper Vanilla, a shader pack created to convey and recreate the long cancelled and forgotten Super Duper Graphics pack.

Now it is your turn. How can you help in this day and age, where there are so many problems that are yet to be solved? In what area do you think you can serve someone in need? Seeing myself now in this course, I want serve and fulfill other's needs - whether it be in the form of solving a physical problem, or a personal problem in someone's life. I know can never fulfil everyone's needs, but I can continue to keep serving my friends and family in humility wherever and whenever I can do. I also hope that I can also teach others this same sense of servitude and humility.
