I spent most of my childhood in the Philippines before coming to Dubai. During my childhood days, I was the bratty kid who wanted everything. I wanted this, I wanted that, and my wants know no end. My parents and my Dad's grandparents had to put up with my antics. Later on though, I was very frustrated on why I couldn't get everything. Then an idea hit me, "Why not make everything yourself?" I discovered I could make anything I wanted, if I had the necessary materials. Like father, like son, I became my own engineer to solve my problems - to make paper toys. My sudden desire to create was more than what I wanted. My imagination overflowed and apparently my brother had the same thought. It later became a problem though as both of us made too much that my grandparents found it as a problem.

This inspiration extended to the digital world as I moved to Dubai. I still made toys like origamis and boardgames but at a reduced scale. My addiction to playing Minecraft also grew by that time - one that isn't healthy. However, while fiddling with Minecraft and watching videos about it, I also came across redstone inventions. I thought it was incredible for such a simple block game and tried it myself. I made all sorts of invention but one invention piqued my Dad's interest - redstone computers. Because of his constant monitor on my screentime and recently watching a movie about Snowden (it is about how the US government had been spying on devices without permission but that's another topic), he decided my next gift for my birthday is a book about coding. Without my Dad's keen eye on me, I would not be in this course now.

Thanks to my parent's inspiration and supportive love, I began my first programming journey. Because of my outstanding confidence that I can make anything, I began programming on the worst workspace possible - the phone. I made basic things like displaying "hello world" with Python and C++. Looking back at it now, I couldn't believe I still pursued programming. This is probably because of my growing love for computers and how people around me find it astonishing how I can easily navigate through a computer first try (yes I'm talking about the boomers). "Programming on a phone can't be that hard," or so I thought. This is the same confidence to create anything that I could imagine that has kept up with me until now.

My Mom was a big fan of movies including my Dad. Lots of inspiration came from binging and rewatching countless movies and series, but movies is what brings us together. After
