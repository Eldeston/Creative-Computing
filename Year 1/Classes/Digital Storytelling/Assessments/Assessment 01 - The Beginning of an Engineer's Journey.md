# The Beginning of an Engineer's Journey
## What makes a story?
A story is a spoken or written, or fictional or non-fictional event which purpose is to express a person's personal experience or an idea to others. Stories are often used to effectively communicate very important topics in various aspects in life, whether you are delivering justice to the people, or destroying the lives of everyone. Having a loving family, or rejecting an outcast. Living out your best in life, or wrapped around in the cold arms of death. Taking revenge to those who offended you, or forgiving to those who ask for your forgiveness.

Storytelling is a powerful tool used to communicate and to share empathy with another person about their experiences and to provoke the person's imagination. Mankind's capability for imagination is a supernatural gift that is unique to us only which inspiration stems from.

Stories can be a series of chronological events pointing towards a bigger picture that provokes an immediate response from the listening audience. The immediate response causes the person to criticize their philosophical values and find personal resolution by reflecting and evaluating their lives. Stories tells us of where we come from or our origin which is used as a foundational block to build our lives upon.

> But I will gladly join the fight (but I will gladly join the fight)
> And when our children tell our story (and when our children tell our story)
> They'll tell the story of tonight..."

## Story patterns and structures
Stories always come in narrative form. Stories can be structured as a personal documentary about how someone very important to you influenced or inspired your life or a personal testimony of a very important event in your life. 

Stories can be written as fiction or non-fiction in chronological order each building up and pointing towards a bigger picture which purpose is to teach a valuable lesson in their life or asks where are you or what you are doing in your life given the current situation you are in. This is commonly used in fictional stories such as fairy tales, epics, and legends. It is also used in inspirational non-fictional movies such as Hacksaw Ridge (2016) whose story is about Desmond Doss exercising and displaying servitude in World War 2 as a medic even in suffering, never using a weapon and even helping out Japanese enemies (as prisoners of war).

Stories will always display or exercise multiple key characters such as humility, leadership, or mercy. Stories often project the author's philosophical views, exposing their understanding of the world and how it is. As the reader or listener is exposed to these views, an immediate response is provoked, evaluating their philosophical values.

# Key Characters: Humility and Servitude
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Frem, I go by the penname Eldeston. I am the founder of **FlameRender Studios.** This is the story of how my work as a shader developer came into being from papers and drawings to lights and shadows.
## Papers and Drawings
I spent most of my childhood in the Philippines before coming to Dubai. I was the bratty kid who wanted everything. I wanted this and that, and my wants know no end for my Parents and my Dad's Grandparents. One day, I was frustrated on why I couldn't get what I want. Then an idea hit me, "Why not make everything yourself?" I discovered I could make anything I wanted, if I had the materials. I became my own engineer to solve my problems by inventing my own toys. My sudden desire to make was more than to want. My imagination overflowed and my brother had the same idea and followed. It later became a problem though as both of us made mess for my Grandparents.
## The Inspiration
My imagination extended to the digital world in Dubai, discovering Minecraft. Minecraft is incredible for such a simple block game and was in love with redstone. I made all sorts of inventions and it piqued my Dad's interest. Because of his watchful eye on me, he decided that my next gift for my birthday is a book about coding and I loved it. Thanks to my parents' support, I began my first programming journey. Because of my outstanding confidence, I programmed on the worst possible workspace - my phone. I made little things like displaying "hello world" with Python and C++. Looking back at it now, I couldn't believe I still pursued programming. "Programming on a phone can't be that hard," or so I thought. Without my Dad's keen eye on me, I would not be in this course now.
## "See a need, fill a need."
Along with the Dubai experience, I watched a lot of movies and my Parents were big fans. Lots of inspiration came from binging countless movies and series, but it is what brings my family together. One particular movie, was Robots (2005). The story is about a young robot, Rodney, who look up to Big Weld with the famous quote, "See a need, fill a need." and this quote is repeated throughout the movie as Rodney helped old robots who could not find the parts to keep their life sustained. Seeing my Dad as the engineer of the house who serves in fixing not only issues in our home, but also in my family's lives. He is the only person in this world who had the biggest influence on me and helped me solved my problems, and there came a day I helped to solve his. He inspired me to not just do something for myself, but to do something for others.
## It is our turn.
This lead into the birth of my projects: FlameRender Studios, a creator community founded by me, Maud (Maudric, aka my brother), and UserNameGoesHere (Aiden), and Super Duper Vanilla, a shader pack created to convey and recreate the long cancelled and forgotten Super Duper Graphics pack.

Now it is your turn. How can you help in this day and age where there are so many problems? What area in YOUR life do you think you can serve someone in need? Seeing myself in this course, I want serve and fulfill other's needs - whether it be in the form of solving a physical problem, or a personal problem in someone's life. I know can never fulfil everyone's needs, but I can continue serving my friends and family in humility wherever and whenever I can do. I also hope that I can also teach others this same sense of servitude and humility.
