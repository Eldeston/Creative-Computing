## The 3 Act structure
A story with a 3 act structure consists of a beginning, crisis, and resolution.
## The “ONE DAY” factor
The day before and after the character takes on a turning point.
## Commercial Storytelling
For most of their existence, TV commercials have been like, **“Hey, buy this product! It’s faster, cheaper, more efficient!”**

Then, around 2012, we saw an increase in commercials that tell stories.

They don’t always talk about the **“selling point,”** which was always a big deal in advertising: Why do you have to buy this product? 

Instead of simply telling you about the benefits of the product, they show **how the advertised product can help you achieve your consumption goals.** It doesn’t really say anything directly about the product, but still it’s very persuasive.

Commercial Storytelling is using a narrative to connect your brand & product to your customers.

People remember stories. 

If you put a story capable of evoking emotions in your viewers, they will never forget the experience.

**Brands do not sell their products anymore...they sell stories.**
## Highlight Micro Moments
“Micro-moments” are those small, often overlooked routines and rituals that make up our daily lives: 
tying our shoelaces, sitting down for coffee, commuting to work, brushing our teeth, enjoying a meal, etc.

Facebook calls them “once-a-day moments,” and for advertisers, they can serve as an especially powerful tool for connecting with audiences; in fact, brands that incorporate these moments can sometimes be easier for us to recall and remember.

- One study found that a painting became 11% more valuable when the artist’s story was featured below it. 
- Small businesses with ethically-made, locally-sourced products can actually increase the perceived value of the products by featuring the story of the workers engaged in the production.
## Digital Storytelling
- Storytelling
	Telling or writing of stories. An ancient art form and a valuable form of human expression. Storytelling should always come in narrative form as you are describing your experience in the form of stories.
- Digital
	Computer-based tools, content and delivery.

> “Digital Storytelling is the modern expression of the ancient art of storytelling.”
> *- Barrett, 2007*

> “Digital storytelling combines the art of telling stories with a variety of digital multimedia, such as images, audio, and video. Just about all digital stories bring together some mixture of digital graphics, text, recorded audio narration, video and music to present information on a specific topic.”
> *- Robin, 2008*

> “Digital storytelling involves the use of graphics, images, pictures, sound, and videos to engage the viewers in an effort to drive emotions, engage intercommunication, and motivate an audience to action.”
> *- Eric and Sacha*
## 5 Elements of Digital Storytelling

	Composition | Layout
- Technology
	Web | App | Game | Slideshow | Videos

> “You can tell any story 20 different ways. The trick is to pick one and go with it.”
> *- Clint Eastwood, American actor, director, producer, and politician*

## Intellectual Property (IP)
Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.
- **Ethical Concerns**
	- Another person is benefitting from someone else’s creativity and effort without paying or crediting the original creator.
	- Why would anyone want to create things if they weren’t going to benefit financially and someone else was?
	- Are there any reasons why you would argue for personal copying or posting content without authorization?
	- People believe that if they change a work enough or use it in a collage, it is not infringement.
	- Many people do not understand  the extent of ownership.
	- If people understood intellectual property rules at the start, they could find works that are in public domain and available in fair use.
- **Important Terms**
	- **Attribution:** Identifying & crediting the source of a work.
	- **Copyright:** A form of legal protection given to the creators of "original works of authorship“.
	- **Copyright infringement:** A violation of the exclusive rights of a copyright holder, such as copying, distributing, or performing the copyright owner's work without permission.
	- **Derivative work:** A new work that translates or transforms one or more original copyrighted works.
	- **Fair use:** Permits a second user to copy part or all of a copyrighted work without permission from the copyright holder.
	- **License:** Permission to use a creative work.
## Copyright
An intellectual work is any original work in the areas of literature, arts or science, whatever its description, form of expression, significance or purpose.

**Author’s Rights:**
- Reproduce the work in copies
- Distribute copies of the work
- Publicly display or perform
- Make derivatives, adaptations, translations
- Authorize others to use any of these rights

Copyright protection is **automatic** once a work is fixed in a tangible medium. Joint authors each have full and equal copyrights.

The meaning of the circled “C” is absolute: 

The work belongs completely to the owner, and no one else may use it, except for research, education, or fair comment. These exceptions mean that most educators and program leaders may use copyrighted materials for teaching, but not for works that will be sold.
