# Intellectual Property (IP)
Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.

**Ethical Concerns**
- Another person is benefitting from someone else’s creativity and effort without paying or crediting the original creator.
- Why would anyone want to create things if they weren’t going to benefit financially and someone else was?
- Are there any reasons why you would argue for personal copying or posting content without authorization?
- People believe that if they change a work enough or use it in a collage, it is not infringement.
- Many people do not understand  the extent of ownership.
- If people understood intellectual property rules at the start, they could find works that are in public domain and available in fair use.

**Important Terms**
- **Attribution:** Identifying & crediting the source of a work.
- **Copyright:** A form of legal protection given to the creators of "original works of authorship“.
- **Copyright infringement:** A violation of the exclusive rights of a copyright holder, such as copying, distributing, or performing the copyright owner's work without permission.
- **Derivative work:** A new work that translates or transforms one or more original copyrighted works.
- **Fair use:** Permits a second user to copy part or all of a copyrighted work without permission from the copyright holder.
- **License:** Permission to use a creative work.
## Copyright
An intellectual work is any original work in the areas of literature, arts or science, whatever its description, form of expression, significance or purpose.

**Author’s Rights**
- Reproduce the work in copies
- Distribute copies of the work
- Publicly display or perform
- Make derivatives, adaptations, translations
- Authorize others to use any of these rights

Copyright protection is **automatic** once a work is fixed in a tangible medium. Joint authors each have full and equal copyrights.

The meaning of the circled “C” is absolute: 

The work belongs completely to the owner, and no one else may use it, except for research, education, or fair comment. These exceptions mean that most educators and program leaders may use copyrighted materials for teaching, but not for works that will be sold.
## Fair Use
**Purpose**
- Criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research and parody.

**Factors**
- Purpose and character of the use, including whether it is commercial nature or for nonprofit educational purpose.
- The nature of the copyrighted work (creative, fact, useful, compilation).
- The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole (a short quote or an entire article).
- The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
## Creative Commons
Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share.

Creative Commons (CC) is less rigid than traditional copyright, in which all rights are reserved, using the expression “some rights reserved.”

## Public Domain
Public Domain are works that for one reason or another are not covered by copyright and are ordinarily free for all to use.
- Type of work not protected under copyright or patent/trademark.
- Work dedicated to public domain by owner.
- No permission is required for works in Public Domain.
- If it’s in public domain, you may use it, but creative honesty requires that you still attribute to the source and author.
## Trademarks
A trademark is any distinguished form of names, words, signatures, letters, figures, graphics, logos, titles, hallmarks, seals, pictures, patterns, announcements, packs or any other marks or group of marks, if they were used or intended to be used either to distinguish goods, products or services.
