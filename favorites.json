        "strInstructions": "This is one recipe a lot of people have requested and I have tried to make it as simple as possible and I hope it will work for you. Make sure you use the right flour which is basically one with raising agents. Adjust the amount of sugar to your taste and try using different flavours to have variety whenever you have them.\r\nYou can use Coconut milk instead of regular milk, you can also add desiccated coconut to the dry flour or other spices like powdered cloves or cinnamon.\r\nFor \u201chealthy looking\u201d mandazis do not roll the dough too thin before frying and use the procedure I have indicated above.\r\n\r\n1. Mix the flour,cinnamon and sugar in a suitable bowl.\r\n2. In a separate bowl whisk the egg into the milk\r\n3. Make a well at the centre of the flour and add the milk and egg mixture and slowly mix to form a dough.\r\n4. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes or until it stops sticking to the sides of the bowl and you have a smooth surface.\r\n5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth  and allow to rest for 15 minutes.\r\n6. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1cm thick piece.\r\n7. Using a sharp small knife, cut the dough into the desired size setting aside ready for deep frying.\r\n8. Heat your oil in a suitable pot and gently dip the mandazi pieces to cook until light brown on the first side then turn to cook on the second side.\r\n9. Serve them warm or cold",

Drain pumpkin; let cool.\r\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Chill for 15 mins. Line the pastry with baking parchment and baking beans, then bake for 15 mins. Remove the beans and paper, and cook for a further 10 mins until the base is pale golden and biscuity. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.\r\nIncrease oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Push the cooled pumpkin through a sieve into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, salt, nutmeg and half the cinnamon. Mix in the beaten eggs, melted butter and milk, then add to the pumpkin pur\u00e9e and stir to combine. Pour into the tart shell and cook for 10 mins, then reduce the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Continue to bake for 35-40 mins until the filling has just set.\r\nLeave to cool, then remove the pie from the tin. Mix the remaining cinnamon with the icing sugar and dust over the pie. Serve chilled.",
